# TRACKMEDIA.oi Plugin for Openplanet

This Openplanet plugin for Trackmania 2020 exposes track and gameplay media data through the Openplanet scripting environment. It is designed for creators who want structured access to their media files from within Trackmania 2020.

The project is written in AngelScript and targets the Openplanet runtime. It includes plugin metadata, API definitions, and bundled assets required at runtime.

To use it, Openplanet must be installed for Trackmania. The plugin is then loaded through the Openplanet scripts system and runs inside the map editor, automatically showing only when in the 'skinning mode'.
